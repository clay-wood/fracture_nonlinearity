	abstract = {An experiment in an oil field at Rangely, Colorado, has demonstrated the feasibility of earthquake control. Variations in seismicity were produced by controlled variations in the fluid pressure in a seismically active zone. Precise earthquake locations revealed that the earthquakes clustered about a fault trending through a zone of high pore pressure produced by secondary recovery operations. Laboratory measurements of the frictional properties of the reservoir rocks and an in situ stress measurement made near the earthquake zone were used to predict the fluid pressure required to trigger earthquakes on preexisting fractures. Fluid pressure was controlled by alternately injecting and recovering water from wells that penetrated the seismic zone. Fluid pressure was monitored in observation wells, and a computer model of the reservoir was used to infer the fluid pressure distributions in the vicinity of the injection wells. The results of this experiment confirm the predicted effect of fluid pressure on earthquake activity and indicate that earthquakes can be controlled wherever we can control the fluid pressure in a fault zone.},

	abstract = {The temporal distribution of induced seismicity following the filling of large reservoirs shows two types of response. At some reservoirs, seismicity begins almost immediately following the first filling of the reservoir. At others, pronounced increases in seismicity are not observed until a number of seasonal filling cycles have passed. These differences in response may correspond to two fundamental mechanisms by which a reservoir can modify the strength of the crust—one related to rapid increases in elastic stress due to the load of the reservoir and the other to the more gradual diffusion of water from the reservoir to hypocentral depths. Decreased strength can arise from changes in either elastic stress (decreased normal stress or increased shear stress) or from decreased effective normal stress due to increased pore pressure. Pore pressure at hypocentral depths can rise rapidly, from a coupled elastic response due to compaction of pore space, or more slowly, with the diffusion of water from the surface.},

	abstract = {Geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) is being investigated as an option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. An environmental concern with this and any other subsurface injection practice is the potential to cause low-level induced seismicity events. Such induced seismic activity may be minimized through careful site characterization and facility operation. Induced seismic activity mostly occurs along previously faulted rocks and may be investigated by analyzing stress conditions at depth, well testing, and geophysical surveying. Cases of induced seismic activity have been documented at waste disposal wells, oil fields, and other sites. Locating an injection facility requires investigation of subsurface geologic structures, review of seismic activity in the area, well testing, seismic monitoring, and modeling of pressure buildup and fluid migration. Special considerations related to the properties of CO2 should be noted for an injection system. Supercritical CO2 liquid is less dense than water and may cause density-driven stress conditions at depth. The fluid may also interact with formation water and rocks, altering permeability and resulting in changes in pressure conditions at depth. Injection of large volumes of CO2 may affect formation pressures in rock units distant from the injection facility. The possibility for seismic activity induced by deep-well injection has been considered when evaluating the disposal of CO2 in deep saline reservoirs. The potential for seismic activity is greatest in seismically vulnerable locations with preexisting faulting. The current framework involving proper siting, system installation, and monitoring provides mechanisms to mitigate the risks of induced seismic activity.},

Combined analysis of the spatial distribution of earthquakes and regional moment tensor focal mechanisms indicate reactivation of a subsurface unnamed and unmapped left-lateral strike-slip fault. Coulomb failure stress change calculations using the relocated seismicity and slip distribution determined from regional moment tensors, allow for the possibility that the Wilzetta-Whitetail fault zone south of Cushing, Oklahoma, could produce a large, damaging earthquake comparable to the 2011 Prague event. Resultant very strong shaking levels (MMI VII) in the epicentral region present the possibility of this potential earthquake causing moderate to heavy damage to national strategic infrastructure and local communities.},

In three study areas that encompass the vast majority of the recent seismicity, we show that the increases in seismicity follow 5- to 10-fold increases in the rates of saltwater disposal. Adjacent areas where there has been relatively little saltwater disposal have had comparatively few recent earthquakes. In the areas of seismic activity, the saltwater disposal principally comes from {\textquotedblleft}produced{\textquotedblright} water, saline pore water that is coproduced with oil and then injected into deeper sedimentary formations. These formations appear to be in hydraulic communication with potentially active faults in crystalline basement, where nearly all the earthquakes are occurring. Although most of the recent earthquakes have posed little danger to the public, the possibility of triggering damaging earthquakes on potentially active basement faults cannot be discounted.},

After the Parkfield earthquake, velocity reduction and nonvolcanic tremor activity remained elevated for more than 3 years and decayed over time, similarly to afterslip derived from GPS (Global Positioning System) measurements. These observations suggest that the seismic velocity changes are related to co-seismic damage in the shallow layers and to deep co-seismic stress change and postseismic stress relaxation within the San Andreas fault zone.},

From these studies at 20 strain levels 10−7<e<10−5, four measures characterizing the nonlinear elastic response of each sample are found. Additionally, each sample is tested with nonlinear resonant ultrasonic spectroscopy and a fifth measure of nonlinear elastic response is found. These five measures of the nonlinear elastic response of the samples (approximately 3 × 6×20 × 5 numbers as each measurement is repeated 3 times) are subjected to careful analysis using model-independent statistical methods, principal component analysis, and fuzzy clustering. This analysis reveals differences among the samples and differences among the nonlinear measures. Four of the nonlinear measures are sensing much the same physical mechanism in the samples. The fifth is seeing something different. This is the case for all samples. Although the same physical mechanisms (two) are operating in all samples, there are distinctive features in the way the physical mechanisms present themselves from sample to sample. This suggests classification of the samples into two groups. The numbers in this study and the classification of the measures/samples constitute an empirical characterization of rock nonlinear elastic properties that can serve as a valuable testing ground for physically based theories that relate rock nonlinear elastic properties to microscopic elastic features.},

Coupled ultrasonic and permeability measurements are presented for Westerly granite samples fractured in situ and used to illuminate the relationship between nonlinear dynamic stiffness and fracture permeability indexed via fracture aperture. We perturb the effective stress field using normal stress and pore pressure oscillations. The velocity of ultrasonic waves transmitted across the fracture is used to infer the evolution of elastic properties and the fracture nonlinearity. Changes in permeability are measured concurrently. We observe that relative changes in wave velocity and permeability, due to both normal stress and pore pressure oscillations, are correlated, such that larger drops in wave velocity (higher nonlinearity) correspond to larger increases in permeability. Our observations suggest that dynamic stressing is more likely to enhance the permeability of fractures that exhibit greater nonlinearity.},

	abstract = {We explore the evolution of friction and permeability of a propped fracture under shear. We examine the effects of normal stress, proppant thickness, proppant size, and fracture wall texture on the frictional and transport response of proppant packs confined between planar fracture surfaces. The proppant-absent and proppant-filled fractures show different frictional strength. For fractures with proppants, the frictional response is mainly controlled by the normal stress and proppant thickness. The depth of shearing-concurrent striations on fracture surfaces suggests that the magnitude of proppant embedment is controlled by the applied normal stress. Under high normal stress, the reduced friction implies that shear slip is more likely to occur on propped fractures in deeper reservoirs. The increase in the number of proppant layers, from monolayer to triple layers, significantly increases the friction of the propped fracture due to the interlocking of the particles and jamming. Permeability of the propped fracture is mainly controlled by the magnitude of the normal stress, the proppant thickness, and the proppant grain size. Permeability of the propped fracture decreases during shearing due to proppant particle crushing and related clogging. Proppants are prone to crushing if the shear loading evolves concurrently with the normal loading. },

However, despite this importance, the poromechanical relationships between fault permeability and strength remain unclear. The present study explores this relationship via laboratory experiments for concurrent shear-flow on smooth fractures of Westerly granite. The novelty of these experiments is that the shear velocity is precisely controlled during the measurement of fracture permeability. Results indicate permeability enhancement during velocity-weakening (potentially unstable) frictional slip. To decipher key processes contributing to this response, we evaluate the state of contacting asperities and of fracture surface asperities via digital rock fracture modeling of statistically equivalent surfaces. We propose two plausible mechanisms constraining the relationship between friction and permeability evolution—one based on changes in asperity contact distribution and one on shear-induced dilation triggered by changes in fault slip velocity. These mechanisms should be taken into account in interpreting field observation such as the abrupt permeability increase of natural faults at the onset of seismic slip.},
